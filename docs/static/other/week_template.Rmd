# Problem set X {#PS05X}

## Information

*Assigned on Tue 10/3, due on Wed 10/11 (Monday schedule) 9am at which point there will be synchronized pull requests.*

You will enter the [Bike Sharing
Demand](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand) Kaggle competition and fit
a linear regression model to predict the number of rentals per hour, however
*using only 3 predictor variables*. Fork a copy of the [PS05
repo](https://github.com/2017-09-Amherst-STAT495/PS05) in the course GitHub
Organization and then clone it in whatever version of RStudio you like. The
focus of this exercise is to argue to decision makers why your 3 chosen
variables provide the most "bang for your buck" in predicting bikeshare demand.

* Teams: 2-3 people at your choosing. Once you've selected your group designate one person as team leader *who has not previously been a team leader*, who will:
    + Create a Slack DM that includes Albert, Andrew Kim (TA), and all team members. So far:
        + Team A: Jonathan, Sarah T, Timothy
        + Team B: Harrison, Christien
    + Submit a single pull request on behalf of the group.
    + Submit a single submission to Kaggle on behalf of the group.
* Deliverables: One ready to submit *pull request* to the [PS05
repo](https://github.com/2017-09-Amherst-STAT495/PS05) (recall the GitHub
[submission
process](https://github.com/2017-09-Amherst-STAT495/README#problem-set-submission-process)).
At the very least, the following files should be modified/added:
    1. `PS05.Rmd`: This should
        + Be well-commented and completely reproducible.
        + Involve an *exploratory data analysis* arguing why you chose the three
        variables you did.
    1. `PS05.html`: The output of `PS05.Rmd`. This will be the presentation file
    for a randomly chosen set of groups on Wed 10/11.
    1. `README.md`: Change `rudeboybert` in the URL to the GitHub ID of the team
    leader so that you can open your team's version of `PS05.html` in a browser
    on Tuesday morning.
    1. `submission.csv`
    1. `screen_shot.png` or `screen_shot.jpg`: A screenshot of your Kaggle ranking.
* Feedback will be delivered by Thursday 10/12 9am. Your group can resubmit your work by Friday 10/13 at 5pm.
* Tips:
    + Think about the projection onto the sheet exercise. What variables provide
    the most "bang for your buck" for understanding what's behind the sheet, in
    this case, the mechanism that determines bikeshare demand.
    + Again, do not worry about your score. This problem set is more about
    process than product.
    + Your decision process for determining which 3 to use can be based
    exclusively on your EDA. However, if you are looking for something "less
    unsystematic", you can use the approaches in the ISLR readings for Chapter 6
    listed above; this kind of approach is strictly optional.
