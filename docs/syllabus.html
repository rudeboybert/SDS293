<ul>
<li><em>“Am I asking questions in class?”</em></li>
<li><em>“Am I asking questions on Slack in <code>#questions</code>?”</em> Even better: <em>“Am I answering my peers’ questions on Slack?”</em></li>

<li><strong>Lectures, labs, and readings:</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>“Am I staying on top Slack notifications sent between lectures?”</em> If you need help developing a notification strategy that best suits your lifestyle, please speak to me.</li>
<li><em>“Am I attending lectures consistently?”</em></li>
<li><em>“Am I actually running the code and studying the outputs in R during in-class exercises, or am I just going through the motions?”</em></li>
<li><em>“During in-class exercises, am I taking full advantage that I’m in the same place at the same time with the instructor, the lab assistants, and most importantly your peers, or am I browsing the web/texting the whole time?”</em></li>
<li><em>“Have I been doing the associated readings for each lecture?”</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Problem sets, DataCamp, and coding:</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>“Am I actually doing the problem sets?”</em></li>

<li><strong>Unofficial course description</strong>: A course on the theoretical underpinnings of machine learning. Fundamental concepts of machine learning, such as crossvalidation and the bias-variance tradeoff, will be viewed through both statistical and mathematical lenses. As much of the coursework will center around participation in <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle competitions</a>, there will be greater emphasis on supervised learning techniques including regression, smoothing methods, classification, and regularization/shrinkage methods. To this end, there will be a large computational component to the course, in particular the use of tools for data visualization, data wrangling, and data modeling.</li>

We will use chiefly use the following available textbooks:

1. ["Happy Git and GitHub for the useR"](http://happygitwithr.com/) by Jenny Bryan.
1. ["An Introduction to Statistical Learning"](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani. We'll refer to this as "ISLR.""
1. ["Computer Age Statistical Inference"](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/CASI/) by Efron and Tibshirani. We'll refer to this as "CASI."
1. ["The Elements of Statitiscal Learning"](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/) by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman. We'll refer to this as "ESL."

The latter three are all supplemental resources: use these if you find chalk talks and the course main page are lacking in any
regard. That being said, here is a rough hierarchy of how I much I refer to them:

1. ISLR: Most of my notes center around this text, which is targeted at undergraduates.
1. ESL: This is the graduate version of ISLR, and predates ISLR by a few years.
1. CASI: A 30,000 foot overview of the past, present, and future of statistics/data science/machine learning. We'll refer to this occationally.

## Weekly Problem Sets 10%

* Total of 10 problem sets: assigned during Tuesday labs, due the following week.
* Two lowest scores dropped. 
* The problem sets in this class should be viewed as low-stakes opportunities to
practice, instead of evaluative tools used by the instructor to assign grades.
**Each problem set is worth 1% of your final grade**.


## Weekly Problem Sets 20% {#problem_sets}

The problem sets in this class should be viewed as low-stakes opportunities to
practice, instead of evaluative tools used by the instructor to assign grades.

* ~~Basic structure~~: Updated below
    1. ~~You will be randomly assigned into pairs.~~
    1. ~~You will complete the problem set and submit it via GitHub pull request.~~
    1. ~~On the due date, I will pick a certain number of teams at random to present their findings.~~
    1. ~~You will have the option of updating your submissions.~~
* Sometimes problem sets will be individual, sometimes you will choose groups, sometimes you'll be randomly assigned into groups.
* Typical problem set timeline
    + Tuesday: problem set assigned
    + The following Tuesday 8:30am:
        + Submitted via a synchronized pull request by you/your team leader
        + Presentations (if applicable)
    + By Wednesday 9am: The TA will give feedback over GitHub. Do not commit/push any new changes until you've received the feedback.
    + By Thursday 8:30am: Revise/resubmit your work. There is no need to create a new pull request; the existing one will be updated.
    + By Monday: Albert will give his feedback and the grade. 
* Policy on collaboration:
    + While I encourage you to discuss problem sets with your peers, you must submit
your own answers and not simple rewordings of another's work.
    + As per the Amherst College Student Code of Conduct's statement on [intellectual responbisility and plagiarism](https://www.amherst.edu/offices/student-affairs/community-standards/intellectual-responsibility-and-plagiarism) **all collaborations must be explicitly acknowledged in your submissions**.
* Lowest two scores dropped.
* No extensions for problem sets will be granted. 


## DataCamp Assignments 5% {#datacamp}

* Assigned during Tuesday labs, due the following week.
* DataCamp is meant to be low stakes-practice, so the only thing that matters for your grade is whether you complete the course. So while things like the number of hints/solutions taken don't factor into your grade, it is important to make a good faith effort to answer these questions the best you can.
* While you may do them in advance if you are curious, it is most definitely not required. Note that the DataCamp schedule may change, with certain courses dropped/added.
* Jenny will talk more about DataCamp during Lab 2.


* Taking notes based on what you cover is not required, but please do so if you feel you will benefit. 
* I *expect* most people to take no more than 4 hours per DataCamp assignment.
* Please note retention of the material will not be perfect the first time through. The only way to really retain the material is via lots of practice/doing. For now, think of this as a introduction.


## Term Project 25% {#termproject}

See [Term Project](term_project.html) page.


## Three Midterms: 45%

* There will be three self-scheduled midterms, including one during finals week. See the [Midterms](midterms.html) page.
* Lowest score weighted 10%, middle score weighted 15%, and highest score weighted 20%.

There will be three midterms: two during the semester, one during finals week (dates posted under [Basic information](#basicinfo)).

* Two highest scores are weighted 15% each, lowest is weighted 10%. 
* All midterms are cumulative.
* There will be no make-up nor rescheduled midterms, except in the following
cases if documentation is provided (e.g. a dean's note):
    + serious illness or death in the family.
    + athletic commitments, religious obligations, and job interviews if
    prior notice is given. In such cases, rescheduled exams must be taken
    *after* the rest of the class.
* There will be no extra-credit work to improve midterm scores after the fact.


## Engagement 5% {#engagement}

It is difficult to explicit codify what constitutes "an engaged student," so
instead I present the following rough principle I will follow: *you'll only get
out of this class as much as you put in*. That being said, here are multiple
pathways for you to stay engaged in this class:

* Asking and answering question in class.
* Coming to office hours.
* Posting questions on Slack. Even better, responding to questions on Slack.
* Getting good peer evaluations for your term project.

It is difficult to explicit codify what constitutes "an engaged student," so 
instead I present the following rough principle I will follow: *you'll only get
out of this class as much as you put in*. Some examples of behavior counter to
this principle:

* Not participating in in-class exercises.
* Engaging so little with me, either in class or during office hours, that I
don't know what your voice sounds like.
* Submitting a problem set that has code or content that is copied from or is
only a slightly modified version of your peers' work.



## Policies

1. **Collaboration**: While I encourage you to work with your peers for problem
sets and labs, you must submit your own answers and not simple rewordings of
another's work. Furthermore, all collaborations must be explicitly acknowledged
in your submissions.
1. **Honor Code**: All your work must follow the [Smith College Academic Honor
Code Statement](https://www.smith.edu/sao/handbook/socialconduct/honorcode.php){target="_blank"};
in particular all external sources must be cited in your submissions.
1. **Problem sets**:
    + No extensions will be granted without a dean's note.
    + To receive full credit, you must show your work and explain your reasoning in your solutions. 
    + All written problem sets must be handed in at the start of lecture. No emailed submissions will be accepted; if you can't make it to class ask a classmate to turn it in for you. They must be stapled with the fringe/perf from any spiral notebook paper removed. 
1. **Midterms/quizzes**:
    + No make-up midterms will be allowed without a dean's note. 
    + Timestamps for all midterms will be strictly enforced.
1. **Grading**: I reserve the right to not discuss any grading issues in class and instead direct you to office hours.
