# Midterm I {#midtermI}

## Administrative notes

* **Friday 2/22 5pm through Sunday 2/24 11:55pm**.
* Self-scheduled exam [instructions](http://www.science.smith.edu/self-scheduled-exam-printing/){target="_blank"}. In particular:
    + Only print from macOS computers.
    + At some point you'll need to wait 5-10 seconds for a "paper is held in queue" pop-up box to appear before you can print.
* You will be given 140 mins to complete it (including transit time to writing area), however I try to time it so that it will take much less than that. In other words, you should have plenty of time to complete it without rushing.
* **Timestamps will be strictly enforced. Any timestamps indicating than more than 140 minutes are subject to a 50% penalty and an honor board case.**
* Closed-book, no internet, and individually completed.


## Topics
    
* Topics: All topics covered so far, but not regression.
* What to study:
    + Lec01 Slides: A minimally-viable explanation of machine learning in 60min.
    + General modeling framework: $y = f(\vec{x}) + \epsilon$ vs $\hat{y} = \hat{f}(\vec{x})$ .See "Modeling with data in the tidyverse" DataCamp Chapter 1 videos for more info.
    + Machine learning problem: underfitting/overfitting, measures of model complexity, training/test set splitting, cross-validation.
    + Splines: describe qualitatively how model is fit.
    + Class chalk talk notes
    + `MP1_albert.Rmd`
* No direct coding, but you will have to write pseudocode.

# Midterm II {#midtermII}

## Administrative notes

* **Friday 4/5 5pm through Sunday 4/7 11:55pm**. 
    
<!--

* Closed-book, no internet, and individually completed.

* You must take it no more than 120 minutes (including transit time) to complete it and submit it by 11:55pm on Sunday. Timestamps will be verified and any exam with timestamps indicating more than 120 minutes will be docked 50%.
* Please bring:
    + Colored pens
    + A calculator: TI-84 type calculators acceptable, mobile phone apps are not. 
* Extra help:
    + Jenny office hours. Book appointments [here](https://jennysmetzer.youcanbook.me/){target="_blank"}.
    + Albert extra office hours Friday 11/2 2:30-4pm in McConnell 215.
* Read cover page (slightly different from last time):

![](static/exams/midterm_II_cover_page.png){ width=600px }   


## Topics

* Topics:
    1. Lectures 1-18. Yes it is cummulative in that topics build on top of each other, but focus is on Lec 8-18 on Data Wrangling and Basic Regression with one explanatory variable (no Multiple Regression with more than one explanatory variable).
    1. The corresponding "chalk talk" notes and ModernDive readings in Chapter 1 through 6.
* Types of questions:
    + Before Wednesday, do the practice midterm questions [PDF](static/exams/Midterm-II_practice.pdf){target="_blank"}. I **do not** have a PDF of solutions, we'll cover these in class on Wednesday. Note this is a compilation of a few midterms, so its length is not reflective of what you can expect on the midterm. Do the following questions:
        1. Question 3 - Life Expectancy: All.
        1. Question 1 - Short Answer: Parts a) 1-4, b), d), e)
        1. Question 2 - Teaching Evaluations (optional). If you can do this multiple regression question, you'll be in good shape for understanding basic regression
    + Go over all problem sets and solutions.
    + Data Wrangling:
        1. Be able to understand data wrangling actual code, be able to write data wrangling pseudocode. 
        1. Jenny's [Data Wrangling Lab](index.html#lab1) on Thu 10/18 + Tue 10/23. Solutions now posted.
    + Data Modeling: Go over [Modeling with Data in the Tidyverse](https://www.datacamp.com/teach/repositories/1575/branches/master){target="_blank"} Chapters 1 and 2.

# Midterm III {#midtermIII}

## Administrative notes

* **TBD: during finals week**.

## Topics

* Topics:
    1. Lectures 1-28 but not the "tacticle resampling simulation". Yes it is cummulative in that topics build on top of each other, but focus is on Lec 19-28 on multiple regression and sampling.
    1. The corresponding "chalk talk" notes and ModernDive readings in Chapter 1 through 8.
* Types of questions:
    + Before Wednesday, do the practice midterm questions [PDF](static/exams/Midterm-III_practice.pdf){target="_blank"}. I **do not** have a PDF of solutions, we'll cover these in class on Wednesday. Note this is a compilation of a few midterms, so its length is not reflective of what you can expect on the midterm. Do the following questions:
        1. Question 1 - Obama polling: Parts a), b), c), d), e), 
        1. Question 2 - Teaching evaluations: All parts. Note this question was also included in practice midterm II.
        1. Question 2 - Sampling: Parts a), b), c), d), e), f), g), h)
        1. Question 4 - Pennies: Parts a), c), e), f).
    + Data Modeling: Go over [Modeling with Data in the Tidyverse](https://www.datacamp.com/teach/repositories/1575/branches/master){target="_blank"} Chapters 3 and 4.
    + Go over all problem sets and solutions. Note PS10 solutions will be posted right after lecture on Wed 11/28.
    

## Midterm III Distribution

![](static/exams/midterm_III_distribution.png){ width=600px } 

Note about Question 3.b) from the Wikipedia page for the [Kinsey Reports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_Reports){target="_blank"}:

In 1948, the same year as the original publication, a committee of the American Statistical Association, including notable statisticians such as John Tukey, condemned the sampling procedure. Tukey was perhaps the most vocal critic, saying, 

> "A random selection of three people would have been better than a group of 300 chosen by Mr. Kinsey."

Psychologist Abraham Maslow asserted that Kinsey did not consider "volunteer bias".
