### 2. Tweet of the Day

Even though the `yardstick` package already existed, the developers of `tidyroc` know that they still learned a ton about R package developement. They will leverage these new skills for their next project! 

**Moral of the story**: Turn your disappointments into your next success! From Dariya Sydykova's blog post:

> In conclusion, I do not regret the time and effort it took me to work on `tidyroc`... As a believer in the growth mindset, I like to focus on the things that I have learned and on the ways that I have improved myself. I got to implement `devtools`, `usethis`, and `roxygen2` and to learn a little more about how these work.

## Todays Topics/Activities  

### 1. Chalk Talk

* Intro to logistic regression
* Transforming probability space to log-odds/logit space. The following two plots are the same but with the axes flipped. In other words:
    + The left plot visualizes how we map from probability space $[0,1]$ to log-odds space $(-\infty, \infty)$
    + The right plot visualizes how we map from log-odds space $(-\infty, \infty)$ back to probability space $[0,1]$
* [Code](code.html): Lines 

<!--
Here are the two equations:

$$
\begin{align}
\mbox{left function} = \mbox{log-odds} = \mbox{logit}(p) &= \log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right) = \alpha\\
\mbox{right function} = \mbox{inverse-logit}(\alpha) &= \frac{\exp(\alpha)}{\exp(\alpha) + 1} = \frac{1}{1+ \exp(-\alpha)} = p
\end{align}
$$
--> 

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
eps <- 0.0001
values <- data_frame(
  p = seq(from = eps, to = 1-eps, length = 1000),

# Lec 6: Wed 2/13

## Announcements

Before Lec07 on Monday 2/18:  

* I will post ~~solutions~~ one of many possible approaches to doing `MP1.Rmd` in the [Mini-Projects](MP.html) page by Friday afternoon. Please read these.
* Delete the minimally viable `regression.Rmd` file I sent on Slack during Lec05 on Monday, replace it with this improved file <a href="static/methods/regression/regression_v2.Rmd" download>`regression_v2.Rmd`</a>, and please read it.

Also, I fixed the error in Lec03 exercises solutions in [Code](code.html) page. The issue was inconsistent converting from &deg;F to &deg;C in all `training` and `test` sets; I commented all such code out. The correct visualization of a spline model "trained on June and predicting December temperatures" is below. Observe that the predictions (in blue) overpredict the actual December temperatures (black dots).

![](static/images/train_june_test_december.png){ width=600px }

Remember:

> For your predictions to be valid, the data used to train your model must be at least somewhat representative of the test data you're making predictions on!

In other words:

## Todays Topics/Activities  

### 1. Chalk Talk

Brief discussion on "looking at your data" inspired by tweet of the day below.

### 2. Tweet of the day

Why is important to `glimpse()` and `View()` your data frames? Because **looking at your data** is so deceptively simple that many people forget or ignore this step, even analysts/engineers with PhD's at Google! Before any modeling, you must getting a sense of:

1. **What types of variables you have in your columns?** Numerical, categorical, text, dates?
1. **What values you have in your cells?** Units of any measurements?
1. **What is the quality of your data?** Do you have missing data? Are there crazy outliers?

These are the most fundamental steps to take before any modeling or data analysis!  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Shout-out to people like me who like taking a look at even huge tables of raw data before summarizing or transforming, to get a sense of what&#39;s in there and spot potential data quality issues.

## Todays Topics/Activities  

### 1. Chalk Talk

* Discussion of solutions to Lec03 code exercises.
* Recap of Lec04: crossvalidation
* Regression

### 2. Tweet of the day

Shared with me by Dr. Jenny Smetzer. I agree with Ms. Damour's opinion.  You don't have to, but her ideas are still worth thinking about. They relate to "points of diminishing returns" and "polishing the cannonball" as discussed for mini-project 1. Here are some excerpts:

* "Overqualified and overprepared, too many women still hold back. Women feel confident only when they are perfect." IMO this applies to more demographic groups than just women.
* "First, parents and teachers can stop praising inefficient overwork, even if it results in good grades."
* "A colleague of mine likes to remind teenagers that in classes where any score above 90 counts as an A, the different between a 91 and a 99 is a life." In other words, [work-life balance](syllabus.html#work-life-balance).

# Lec 1: Mon 1/27

## Announcements

* If you haven’t already, please go over the following [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NfWkoyeiovkVyMmgmKFGxCMusyxBMYHVvsAUjEZv_fU/){target="_blank"} with important information about the course and steps you should complete to get setup, in particular the Intro Survey. The whole process should take about 20 minutes.
* **Added on Sun 1/27 6PM**: Create an account on Kaggle.com using your Smith (or Five College) email address. 



## Todays Topics/Activities       

### 1. Chalk Talk

*Why chalk talks? Read the [Field Notes](https://twitter.com/FieldNotesBrand){target="_blank"} slogan.*

[Lec01 slides](http://rudeboybert.rbind.io/talk/2019-01-13-Williams.pdf){target="_blank"} + 2 chalk talks. 


### 2. Background I will assume

1. You have seen multiple regression before (not necessarily taken a class on it).
1. The `tidyverse` suite of R packages for data science, in particular `ggplot2` and `dplyr`.

For more information about what level you should know this, please see the [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NfWkoyeiovkVyMmgmKFGxCMusyxBMYHVvsAUjEZv_fU/){target="_blank"} -> Email from December.


### 3. Prepartion for Lec02

I **highly** recommend you start these steps as soon as you can, so that you'll have two chances to go to the Spinelli tutoring hours if you need help before Wednesday's lecture. Note the Spinelli tutoring hours are Sun-Thurs 7-9pm in Sabin-Reed 301.

1. Have R and RStudio installed on your laptops. 
1. Install some extra tools:
    + macOS users: Go to Apple's [developer page](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/){target="_blank"} and install the appropriate version of Command Line Tools. Hint: Google "How do I know what version of macOS I have?"
    + Windows users: Install [`Rtools35.exe`](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/){target="_blank"}.
1. Install the standard versions of the `tidyverse` and `devtools` packages as you normally would.
1. Install the *development version* of the `moderndive` package by running: `devtools::install_github("moderndive/moderndive")`
1. Run the code below. If you get no errors and a file `submission.csv` gets saved to your computer, you're ready for Lec02!

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(moderndive)

# 1. Load in training and test data
train <- read_csv("https://rudeboybert.github.io/SDS293/static/train.csv")
test <- read_csv("https://rudeboybert.github.io/SDS293/static/test.csv")

# 2. Fit model on training data
house_model <- lm(SalePrice ~ YrSold, data = train)

# 3. Apply fitted model to get predictions for test data
submission <- get_regression_points(house_model, newdata = test, ID = "Id") %>% 
  select(Id, SalePrice = SalePrice_hat)

# 4. Output predictions to CSV
write_csv(submission, "submission.csv")
```
