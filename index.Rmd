# Lec 04: Mon 2/3

## Announcements

* For this week's lectures, sit with your PS1 teammate. The groups are posted on Slack under `#general`
* Lecture policies
    + You don't need to inform me about occasional absenses, but please give your teammate a heads up as a curtesy.
    + Please do not leave in the middle lecture, unless you get prior approval from me, as this can be very distracting. After you get prior approval, please sit near the exit.
* [PS1 is now ready!](PS.html#PS1)


## What is a minimally viable product?

When building a product, in my opinion (IMO):

* **Don't**: Try to do everything completely and perfectly from the beginning. This leads perfectionism, which leads to procrastination and "analysis paralysis."
* **Do**: Start by finishing a [minimially viable product](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/minimum-viable-product-mvp-and-design-balancing-risk-to-gain-reward){target="_blank"} ASAP!

Once you're done your MVP, iterate and improve by slowly adding complexity that work:

In other words:

* [Done is better than perfect](https://lifehacker.com/done-is-better-than-perfect-5870379){target="_blank"}
* [Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dont-let-the-perfect-be-t_b_158673){target="_blank"}
* [Think big, start small](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chunkamui/2016/01/03/6-words/#15457a371a3b){target="_blank"}


## Topics

* In-class demo
* Open `MassMutual` RStudio Project -> `coding.Rmd` -> `# Tuesday, July 23 2019` -> `## Gentle Introduction to Kaggle Competitions`. Discussion on:
    + "Minimally viable product" model $\widehat{y} = \overline{y}$ for *all* houses.
    + log10-transformations:
        * A [discussion on orders of magnitude](https://moderndive.com/A-appendixA.html#appendix-log10-transformations){target="_blank"} as well as another [house prices example](https://moderndive.netlify.com/11-thinking-with-data.html#house-prices-EDA-I){target="_blank"} of a log10-transformation.

# Lec 03: Fri 1/31

## Announcements

* GitHub organization for this class:
    + Access it by clicking the "octocat" icon on the top left of this page
    + Ensure you are a member (I sent an email invite yesterday)
* GitHub profile. Think of it as an extension of your resume. I highly encourage, but do not require, you to:
    + Post your full name
    + Post your affiliation
    + Post a public-facing profile picture (it doesn't have to be an image of you, it can be any picture).
    + Please don't change your GitHub ID's mid-semester!
* FYI: GitHub is not without [controversy](https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/github-faces-more-resignations-in-light-of-ice-contract/){target="_blank"}

## Topics

GitHub has many definitions that are unforunately not straight forward. Using [`fivethirtyeight`](https://github.com/rudeboybert/fivethirtyeight){target="_blank"} R package as an example.

* Git vs GitHub
* Local vs remote
* Repos & `README.md` files as cover pages
* Cloning a repo locally (which in our case correspond to RStudio Projects). Ex: Big green "Clone or download" button on top right.
* Commit/push and pull. Commits as units of change. Ex: Click "commits" tab on top left (currently at 523 commits)
* Branches: `master` branch is what you see. Ex: Click "Branch" button on top left 
* Making contributions to `master`
    + When on the inside: Create a new branch, make edits in branch, then make pull request
    + When on the outside: Fork the repo (similar to creating a branch), make edits in your forked copye of repo, then make pull request
    + Ex: Click on Insights tab on top right -> Network -> Scroll to earlier dates. 
* Learning git has a steep learning curve. This is normal:
    + [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1597/){target="_blank"}
    + [Oh shit, git!](https://gumroad.com/l/oh-shit-git){target="_blank"}
    + In this class: I'll (gently) force you to practice merge conflicts
