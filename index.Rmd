# Lec 06: Fri 2/7

## Announcements

* PS1
    + Sit next to your PS1 teammate for today's in-class exercise
    + Albert will go over some PS1 highlights
* PS2: Groups posted, but do not clone PS2 repos until I say so. It will involve:
    1. Creating a model with 3 numerical & 3 categorical variables
    1. Applying your fitted model to the training data, comparing $y$ and $\hat{y}$, and computing RMLSE using `mutate()`
* Open [syllabus](syllabus.html): office hours calendar posted on top. 
* If you haven't already, please change your default GitHub profile picture. It doesn't have to be a picture of you, but please put an image. This will help me quickly identify who's who. 


## Topics

### 1. Lec05 Recap

Exercise from Lec05 -> MassMutual RStudio Project -> Tuesday -> Exercise: Submit Kaggle predictions using linear regression model.

1. What issues did you encounter?
1. What variables did you use? Did you not use? 
    
    
### 2. Git merge conflicts

In-class exercise. The screencast is posted [here](https://www.loom.com/share/83499c93430c4ff6a9f3d08478606a88){target="_blank"}.

1. Open:
    + RStudio -> PS1 RStudio Project
    + GitHub organization for this class (click octocat button on top)
1. Both of you, "pull" your repo to update it
1. Both of you, edit *the same line* in `README.md`, but write something different.
1. Both of you, commit your change but do not push it yet.
1. Only one of you (call them person A), push your commit.
1. Person B: Try to push your commit. You won't be able to because you have a *merge conflict*. You need to resolve it.
1. Person B: "Pull" your repo to bring in the merge conflict.
1. Both of you, resolve the merge conflict together.


### 3. Ethical discussion

The `iris` dataset has historically been one of the most widely used datasets in statistics, first collected by Ronald A. Fisher. Type `?iris` in the console and look at "Source." While Fisher has done a lot to advance the field, some of his views were IMO [problematic](https://njoselson.github.io/Fisher-Pearson/){target="_blank"}.


### 4. Classification & Regression Trees

Open:

* MassMutual RStudio Project
    + `coding.Rmd` -> Tuesday -> `iris` Dataset
    + `CART.Rmd` shiny app

# Lec 04: Mon 2/3

## Announcements

* For this week's lectures, sit with your PS1 teammate. The groups are posted on Slack under `#general`
* Lecture policies
    + You don't need to inform me about occasional absenses, but please give your teammate a heads up as a curtesy.
    + Please do not leave in the middle lecture, unless you get prior approval from me, as this can be very distracting. After you get prior approval, please sit near the exit.
* [PS1 is now ready!](PS.html#PS1)


## What is a minimally viable product?

When building a product, in my opinion (IMO):

* **Don't**: Try to do everything completely and perfectly from the beginning. This leads perfectionism, which leads to procrastination and "analysis paralysis."
* **Do**: Start by finishing a [minimially viable product](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/minimum-viable-product-mvp-and-design-balancing-risk-to-gain-reward){target="_blank"} ASAP!

Once you're done your MVP, iterate and improve by slowly adding complexity that work:

In other words:

* [Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dont-let-the-perfect-be-t_b_158673){target="_blank"}
* [Think big, start small](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chunkamui/2016/01/03/6-words/#15457a371a3b){target="_blank"}


## Topics

* In-class demo
* Open `MassMutual` RStudio Project -> `coding.Rmd` -> `# Tuesday, July 23 2019` -> `## Gentle Introduction to Kaggle Competitions`. Discussion on:
    + "Minimally viable product" model $\widehat{y} = \overline{y}$ for *all* houses.
    + log10-transformations:
        * A [discussion on orders of magnitude](https://moderndive.com/A-appendixA.html#appendix-log10-transformations){target="_blank"} as well as another [house prices example](https://moderndive.netlify.com/11-thinking-with-data.html#house-prices-EDA-I){target="_blank"} of a log10-transformation.
        * [Powers of Ten](https://youtu.be/0fKBhvDjuy0?t=40){target="_blank"} movie by Charles and Ray Eames.

# Lec 03: Fri 1/31

## Announcements

* GitHub organization for this class:
    + Access it by clicking the "octocat" icon on the top left of this page
    + Ensure you are a member (I sent an email invite yesterday)
* GitHub profile. Think of it as an extension of your resume. I highly encourage, but do not require, you to:
    + Post your full name
    + Post your affiliation
    + Post a public-facing profile picture (it doesn't have to be an image of you, it can be any picture).
    + Please don't change your GitHub ID's mid-semester!
* FYI: GitHub is not without [controversy](https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/github-faces-more-resignations-in-light-of-ice-contract/){target="_blank"}

## Topics

GitHub has many definitions that are unforunately not straight forward. Using [`fivethirtyeight`](https://github.com/rudeboybert/fivethirtyeight){target="_blank"} R package as an example.

* Git vs GitHub
* Local vs remote
* Repos & `README.md` files as cover pages
* Cloning a repo locally (which in our case correspond to RStudio Projects). Ex: Big green "Clone or download" button on top right.
* Commit/push and pull. Commits as units of change. Ex: Click "commits" tab on top left (currently at 523 commits)
* Branches: `master` branch is what you see. Ex: Click "Branch" button on top left 
* Making contributions to `master`
    + When on the inside: Create a new branch, make edits in branch, then make pull request
    + When on the outside: Fork the repo (similar to creating a branch), make edits in your forked copye of repo, then make pull request
    + Ex: Click on Insights tab on top right -> Network -> Scroll to earlier dates. 
* Learning git has a steep learning curve. This is normal:
    + [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1597/){target="_blank"}
    + [Oh shit, git!](https://gumroad.com/l/oh-shit-git){target="_blank"}
    + In this class: I'll (gently) force you to practice merge conflicts
