## Announcements

* 


## Topics

* GitHub profile. Think of it as an extension of your resume. I highly encourage (but do not require)
    + You post your full name
    + A profile picture that you are comfortable being public facing. It doesn't have to be an image of you, it can be an image.
    + Affiliation
    + Please don't change your GitHub ID's mid-semester!
* Terminology:
    + Git vs GitHub. Other online interfaces to Git exist, like BitBucket and GitLab. GitHub is not without [controversy](https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/github-faces-more-resignations-in-light-of-ice-contract/){target="_blank"}. 
    + Cloning a repo. In our case, they correspond to RStudio Project folders
    + local vs remote
    + commit/push and pull. Commits as units of change.
    + master branch
    + When on the inside: branch + pull request
    + When on the outside: fork + pull request
    + Oh shit, git! Ex: merge conflicts.
* GitHub Classroom:
    + Layer around standard GitHub organization
    + Based on [GitHub organization](https://github.com/293-2020-01-Fall){target="_blank"}. Accept membership please!
