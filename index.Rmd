# Lec 25: Mon 4/6

## Announcements

Midterm I has been graded and distributed.

1. You have the option to re-do Question 2 during Midterm II. As such, there are two grades on Moodle: one for Question 2 and one for the rest.
1. Distribution of scores:  
![](static/midtermI.png){ width=90% }
1. When studying for midterm II, I *highly* recommend you watch this screencast going over the solutions because some variation of some of the questions will likely occur for Midterm II.

## Chalk Talk


1. ICYMI: The "An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R" is a good reference to have in case you want additional explanation. You can download a PDF [here](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/){target="_blank"}. For example, today's lecture on Random Forests is based on book page 316 (corresponding to PDF page 330).
1. Have the following ready before you watch the screencast:
    1. In your browser, easy access to the images below
    1. In another tab of your browser, ModernDive [Chapter 8 on Bootstrapping](https://moderndive.com/8-confidence-intervals.html){target="_blank"}. In particular, the beginning of Chapter 8 until the end of section 8.2 acts as a refresher on Bootstrapping.
    1. MassMutual -> `LASSO.R`. Load all the package then go to around line 59 where you fit a LASSO model with `glmnet(..., alpha = 1, ...)`. Then load the help file by running `?glmnet`
    

### 1. Closing out LASSO

A "Previously on SDS293" episode recap in images:

1. Image 1: LASSO for model selection AKA variable/feature selection:  
![](static/images/ML_Flashcards/Lasso_For_Feature_Selection_web.png){ width=50% }
1. Image 2: More on feature selection:  
![](static/images/ML_Flashcards/Feature_Selection_Strategies_web.png){ width=50% }
1. Image 3: LASSO is almost identical to another regularization method called "ridge regression."  
![](static/images/ML_Flashcards/Ridge_Regression_web.png){ width=50% }
1. Image 4: The alpha you see below is akin to $\lambda$ in LASSO  
![](static/images/ML_Flashcards/Alpha_In_Ridge_Regression_web.png){ width=50% }



## 2. Random Forests

A "Next time on SDS293" episode sneak peak in images:

1. Image 1: General class of methods called "ensemble" methods:  
![](static/images/ML_Flashcards/Ensemble_Methods_web.png){ width=50% }
1. Image 2:  Random forests are one such "ensemble" method:  
![](static/images/ML_Flashcards/Random_Forest_web.png){ width=50% }
1. Image 3:  Bootstrap resampling with replacement:  
![](static/images/ML_Flashcards/Bootstrap_web.png){ width=50% }
1. Image 4: Bagging is another class of methods that uses bootstrapping: 
![](static/images/ML_Flashcards/Bagging_web.png){ width=50% }
1. Image 5: But wait, there's more! Injecting a second source of variation
![](static/images/ML_Flashcards/The_Random_In_Random_Forest_web.png){ width=50% }

Here is a preview of the `random_forests.Rmd` file I'll be sharing with you for Wednesday's Lec26

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(randomForest)

# Load data and select only subset of variables:
train <- read_csv("https://rudeboybert.github.io/SDS293/static/train.csv") %>% 
  select(Id, CentralAir, Fireplaces, GrLivArea, YearBuilt, FullBath, SalePrice) %>% 
  # Convert to 1/0
  mutate(CentralAir = ifelse(CentralAir == "Y", 1, 0))
test <- read_csv("https://rudeboybert.github.io/SDS293/static/test.csv") %>% 
  select(Id, CentralAir, Fireplaces, GrLivArea, YearBuilt, FullBath) %>% 
  # Convert to 1/0
  mutate(CentralAir = ifelse(CentralAir == "Y", 1, 0))

# Transform outcome variable space:
train <- train %>% 
  mutate(logSalePrice = log(SalePrice + 1))

# Define model formula
model_formula <-
  "logSalePrice ~ CentralAir + Fireplaces + GrLivArea + YearBuilt + FullBath" %>%
  as.formula()

# Fit random forest:
model_rf <- randomForest(
  # Model formula
  form = model_formula,
  # Training data
  data = train, 
  # At each node of tree, number of features/predictor variables to randomly
  # choose from for splitting:
  mtry = 2,
  # Number of trees in your forest
  ntree = 100 
)

# Predict on test data
test <- test %>% 
  mutate(
    logSalePrice_hat = predict(object = model_rf, newdata = test),
    SalePrice_hat = exp(logSalePrice_hat) -1
  )
```

# Lec 23: Wed 4/1

## Announcements

1. Problem sets: See [Lec22](#Lec22) for announcement about upcoming problem sets.
1. Zoom office hours and appointments:
    1. Posted on the [syllabus](syllabus.html). I will post more office hours once I read over all your survey responses.


## Chalk Talk

1. Recall from Lec01 "What is Machine Learning?" [slide 27](static/what_is_ML.pdf#page=27){target="_blank"}, the 3 models visualized in blue in the bottom three plots:
    1. The left model (straight line) is very low complexity, but it really doesn't fit the points well. The lack of fit can be measured with the *residual sum of squares (RSS)*: the vertical distances between the black points and the blue lines, all squared, and then summed. Note the formula for RSS is the "heart" of the formula for RMSE.
    1. The right model (very squiggly line) fits the data well and thus has a very small RSS, but this comes at the cost of a model with very high complexity. Accordingly, this model probably does not generalize well to other data points coming from the same population.
    1. The middle model (bimodal curve) is the right balance of complexity and fit.
1. The theory behind LASSO:
    1. Go to the MassMutual RStudio Project and open `CART.Rmd` and `LASSO.Rmd` and look at the optimization formulas for both cases. 
    1. Watch the following (20m29s) video    
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/65jwXCYMYIg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
1. If you have questions, ask in the `#questions` Slack channel indicating where your question is referring to. For example: "Video for Lec22.a) 10:52 Shouldn't that be y-hat = y-bar?"
1. Please give any feedback about your video viewing experience in `#general`. Please do not be shy with your criticisms; for remote lectures to work production values matter.



## Coding exercise

1. Using the same `LASSO.R` from Lec22, go over the remainder of the code: section 5, or roughly lines 183-295
1. If you have questions, ask in the `#questions` Slack channel indicating where your question is referring to. For example: "Lec22 `LASSO.R` around line 142 where it says `get_LASSO_coefficients()` what is that?"

1. Transforming probability space to log-odds/logit space. The following two plots are the same but with the axes flipped. In other words:
    + The left plot visualizes how we map from probability space $[0,1]$ to log-odds space $(-\infty, \infty)$
    + The right plot visualizes how we map from log-odds space $(-\infty, \infty)$ back to probability space $[0,1]$  
```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
eps <- 0.0001
values <- tibble(
  p = seq(from = eps, to = 1-eps, length = 1000),
  y = log(p/(1-p))
)
points <- tibble(
  p = c(0.01, 1-0.01, 0.5),
  y = log(p/(1-p)),
  group = factor(1:3)
)

Recap of Lec10:

1. Idea of "validation sets":  
![](static/images/validation_set.png){ width=75% }  
<!--
fit/train model to one set of data, but evaluate it's predictive performance on another set of data. In other words, *validate* the fitted model on another set of data.

1. We want to know the proportion of the sampling bowl's balls that are red. We don't have the energy to do a census, so we take a sample. Why is important to mix the bowl first?  
![](static/images/sampling_bowl_2.jpg){ width=50% }
1. Lec01 "What is Machine Learning?" [slide 26](static/what_is_ML.pdf#page=26){target="_blank"} stresses importance of "validation sets" when training a self-driving car.
    
Today:
    
1. Create a table comparing 3 types of RMSLE scores for two `cp` values: `cp=0` (relatively more complex tree)  & `cp=0.2` (relatively less complex tree)
1. Comparing performance of underfit vs overfit models as a function of model complexity. See Lec01 "What is Machine Learning?" [slide 27](static/what_is_ML.pdf#page=27){target="_blank"}.
1. How do we figure out what is "optimal" model complexity?
    + In other words, the best setting of the "complexity" dial aka knob?
    + For example in MassMutual RStudio Project -> `CART.Rmd` -> best slider value of $\alpha$ = `cp` complexity parameter?

Today's chalk talk on CART is based on the Tuesday PM topics in the [MassMutual Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kBl8ivTeNyVfbV0gvXjBpwnlRWXvZkKuSe0SMTjFB38/edit#heading=h.4llig2jamgry){target="_blank"}. 
![](static/images/ML_Flashcards/Decision_Trees_web.png){ width=50% }


Open the MassMutual RStudio Project:
  
**First:** Based on `coding.Rmd` -> Tuesday -> `iris` dataset. (Note: You might have to do a little debugging to get this to knit, like setting `eval = TRUE` for all code blocks.)

1. What is classification?
1. How do I interpret trees? Binary splits on predictor variables
1. Go over code for CART.

## Announcements

* PS1
    + Sit next to your PS1 teammate for today's in-class exercise
    + Albert will go over some PS1 highlights
* PS2: Groups posted, but do not clone PS2 repos until I say so. It will involve:
    1. Creating a model with 3 numerical & 3 categorical variables
    1. Applying your fitted model to the training data, comparing $y$ and $\hat{y}$, and computing RMLSE using `mutate()`
* Open [syllabus](syllabus.html): office hours calendar posted on top. 
* If you haven't already, please change your default GitHub profile picture. It doesn't have to be a picture of you, but please put an image. This will help me quickly identify who's who. 


## Chalk Talk

### 1. Lec05 Recap

Exercise from Lec05 -> MassMutual RStudio Project -> Tuesday -> Exercise: Submit Kaggle predictions using linear regression model.

1. What issues did you encounter?
1. What variables did you use? Did you not use? 
    
    
### 2. Git merge conflicts

In-class exercise. The screencast is posted [here](https://www.loom.com/share/83499c93430c4ff6a9f3d08478606a88){target="_blank"}.

1. Open:
    + RStudio -> PS1 RStudio Project
    + GitHub organization for this class (click octocat button on top)
1. Both of you, "pull" your repo to update it
1. Both of you, edit *the same line* in `README.md`, but write something different.
1. Both of you, commit your change but do not push it yet.
1. Only one of you (call them person A), push your commit.
1. Person B: Try to push your commit. You won't be able to because you have a *merge conflict*. You need to resolve it.
1. Person B: "Pull" your repo to bring in the merge conflict.
1. Both of you, resolve the merge conflict together.


### 3. Ethical discussion

The `iris` dataset has historically been one of the most widely used datasets in statistics, first collected by Ronald A. Fisher. Type `?iris` in the console and look at "Source." While Fisher has done a lot to advance the field, some of his views were IMO [problematic](https://njoselson.github.io/Fisher-Pearson/){target="_blank"}.


### 4. Classification & Regression Trees

What are classification and regression trees? Here is one example from the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/08/opinion/sunday/party-polarization-quiz.html){target="_blank"}. Note: Smith students can get free access to the New York Times and Wall Street Journal via [Smith Libraries](https://libraries.smith.edu/news/2019/09/new-online-access-new-york-times-and-wall-street-journal){target="_blank"}.

# Lec 04: Mon 2/3

## Announcements

* For this week's lectures, sit with your PS1 teammate. The groups are posted on Slack under `#general`
* Lecture policies
    + You don't need to inform me about occasional absenses, but please give your teammate a heads up as a curtesy.
    + Please do not leave in the middle lecture, unless you get prior approval from me, as this can be very distracting. After you get prior approval, please sit near the exit.
* [PS1 is now ready!](PS.html#PS1)


## What is a minimally viable product?

When building a product, in my opinion (IMO):

* **Don't**: Try to do everything completely and perfectly from the beginning. This leads perfectionism, which leads to procrastination and "analysis paralysis."
* **Do**: Start by finishing a [minimially viable product](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/minimum-viable-product-mvp-and-design-balancing-risk-to-gain-reward){target="_blank"} ASAP!

Once you're done your MVP, iterate and improve by slowly adding complexity that work:

## Chalk Talk

* In-class demo
* Open `MassMutual` RStudio Project -> `coding.Rmd` -> `# Tuesday, July 23 2019` -> `## Gentle Introduction to Kaggle Competitions`. Discussion on:
    + "Minimally viable product" model $\widehat{y} = \overline{y}$ for *all* houses.
    + log10-transformations:
        * A [discussion on orders of magnitude](https://moderndive.com/A-appendixA.html#appendix-log10-transformations){target="_blank"} as well as another [house prices example](https://moderndive.netlify.com/11-thinking-with-data.html#house-prices-EDA-I){target="_blank"} of a log10-transformation.
        * [Powers of Ten](https://youtu.be/0fKBhvDjuy0?t=40){target="_blank"} movie by Charles and Ray Eames.

# Lec 03: Fri 1/31

## Announcements

* GitHub organization for this class:
    + Access it by clicking the "octocat" icon on the top left of this page
    + Ensure you are a member (I sent an email invite yesterday)
* GitHub profile. Think of it as an extension of your resume. I highly encourage, but do not require, you to:
    + Post your full name
    + Post your affiliation
    + Post a public-facing profile picture (it doesn't have to be an image of you, it can be any picture).
    + Please don't change your GitHub ID's mid-semester!
* FYI: GitHub is not without [controversy](https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/github-faces-more-resignations-in-light-of-ice-contract/){target="_blank"}

## Chalk Talk

GitHub has many definitions that are unforunately not straight forward. Using [`fivethirtyeight`](https://github.com/rudeboybert/fivethirtyeight){target="_blank"} R package as an example.

* Git vs GitHub
* Local vs remote
* Repos & `README.md` files as cover pages
* Cloning a repo locally (which in our case correspond to RStudio Projects). Ex: Big green "Clone or download" button on top right.
* Commit/push and pull. Commits as units of change. Ex: Click "commits" tab on top left (currently at 523 commits)
* Branches: `master` branch is what you see. Ex: Click "Branch" button on top left 
* Making contributions to `master`
    + When on the inside: Create a new branch, make edits in branch, then make pull request
    + When on the outside: Fork the repo (similar to creating a branch), make edits in your forked copye of repo, then make pull request
    + Ex: Click on Insights tab on top right -> Network -> Scroll to earlier dates. 
* Learning git has a steep learning curve. This is normal:
    + [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1597/){target="_blank"}
    + [Oh shit, git!](https://gumroad.com/l/oh-shit-git){target="_blank"}
    + In this class: I'll (gently) force you to practice merge conflicts
